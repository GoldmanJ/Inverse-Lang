The Inverse Language
============

TIL is a DSL made with Racket that allows the programmer to define and use the inverses of functions in a streamlined way.
When an invertible function is used, TIL automatically verifies that the function is, in fact, invertible. 
Additionally, TIL comes with a standard library of invertible functions and utilities for defining new invertible functions.
